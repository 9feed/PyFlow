### Description ###

Node based multithreaded extendable editor. For this moment this is just a calc.

UI implemented using PySide, and you can start the editor under any Qt application that uses **Python** as ascripting language.( **Autodesk Maya**, **MotionBuilder**, **Houdini** etc.)

Since that logic and ui are separated you can use no ui classes for your own gui implementations.

This is my learning project of Qt and applicatoin developement. Use this as you wish.
